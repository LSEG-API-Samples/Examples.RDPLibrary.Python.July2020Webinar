# Examples.RDPLibrary.Python.July2020Webinar
 
 These are the three examples that were demonstrated during the **July 2020 Webinar** titled '**How to buildâ€¯content-rich, interactive financial apps with speed and simplicity**'
 
 All three examples use the **config.cfg** which will need to be populated with your credentials e.g.
 
**[session]
app_key = 0abcdd13bf27478987d1c75f2c5fd8fc469123b2
user = GE-A-01234567-8-9101
password = thisisMyDummyPassword12345#
**
(The above are dummy values)

For a desktop session - i.e. connecting to your locally running Eikon Desktop or Refinitiv Workspace, you only need to supply an AppKey - which you can generate using the AppKey generator built into Eikon and Workspace - search for AppKey in the Eikon or Workspace

For a Platform Session you will need a MachineID and password. The MachineID will be provided in a Welcome Email generated by your Account team when you become a Refinitiv Customer or sign up for a Trial Account. The Welcome Email will also contain a link for setting your Password.
If you don't have Eikon or Workspace you can generate an AppKey using the AppKey Generator at https://api.refinitiv.com/ (click the top left corner once logged in).
